Notes for this game

Basic premise:
a player is chosen at random to have a certain amount
of points (possibly real money?). They can divy this money up any way
they'd like between themselves and the n other players. Once the
amounts are decided, each player can accept or reject their offer. If
a certain percent reject it, then no one gets anything. Otherwise,
everyone gets the amount promised. That said, the catch here is that
some or all of the players can view what the other recipients were
offered and their responses in real time. Possibly any of these
players could be robots, too.

- have to define newMove, call submit and setround, and initialize
- update api docs with fetchMove, currentRound
- figure out how moves/rounds are going to work
    - first round is giver round (0), makes n moves when done (+1 for accepting their own offer on next round)
    - after receiving n newmoves, fetch each move by round=0, participant = 1, index = 0..n and update each player (get by index+1) (set ultimatum.givingRound to start round, ultimatum.giverId to 1)

Things that could be done:

- write bots to play
- make this only a one-player game with contrived situations for the giver or receiver
- get a bunch of people from all over the world to play
- vary graphical parameters of the game to see if it makes a difference, or give other functionality like "split evenly" button to see if they do that more
- possibly add the ability for some people to see other players' moves and others to be blind to other amounts / offers
